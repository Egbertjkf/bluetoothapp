# bluetoothapp

Flutter simple app using MethodChannel and Native Code to check bluetooth status 
and enable it
Since i dont have an IPhone i could not test it on IOS, but i think it will work with no problem...

## Getting Started

-Add the bluetooth permissions on plist.info on IOS and to AndroidManifest

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
